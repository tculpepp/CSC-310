# TUI CSC310 - Advanced Programming Topics

This is my course work for CSC310 at TUI winter '22. Everything is in Java, and I'd like to put the disclaimer that I'm new at Java. In reality, I'm new to most lanauges so I can't blame Java for anything.

If this helps someone...awesome, but nothing here should be considered copy/pasta worthy by any means. 

Anyone with some actual progrmming knowledge/skill with comments, I'd love to hear them. At this stage I'm enjoying the learning and there's no ego attached.
