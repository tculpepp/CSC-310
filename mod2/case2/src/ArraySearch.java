/* 
Write a Java application that performs the following task:

1. Create an int array (you can declare the values yourself, or use the Random feature in java to create this array)
2. Sort the data.
3. Prompt user to input an integer from the keyboard
4. Search for the user input value in the array created in step 1 using a simple linear search.
5. Display a message whether the user input has been found in the array, at what position, and how many steps the program required to search for the data value.
6. Search for the user input value in the array created in step 1 using another (hopefully more efficient) search algorithm.
7. Display a message whether the user input has been found in the array, at what position, and how many steps the program required to search for the data value.
