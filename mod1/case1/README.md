# assignment

Write a Java application to calculate how much federal and state tax you need to pay. The program should accomplish the following tasks: ask your name, yearly income, federal tax rate, and state tax rate, then calculate and display the amount of tax you need to pay. Your program must catch user input errors. As the examples given above, use a dialog window to enter program input instead of console-based commands.
